### Features
This a Grayjay plugin for the platform TrilogyPlus.

### Work in progress (WIP)
Literally everything, don't try this yet. If you want to give me feedback feel free to.

## Development

### Prepare
- `npm install`

### Build
- `npm run build`
- `npm start` - will build and watch for changes

### Notes
- Content of the 'build' folder should not be manually changed since it's recreated for each build. 
- Used [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) to bundle the scripts.
